Full Project Plan for the ML Pipeline and MLOps Assignment
Phase 1: Project Definition and Setup
1. Select Use Case and Dataset

Continue from your earlier introduction to ML project but switch the data type to images or audio.

Recommended examples:

Image classification with CIFAR10, MNIST, chest X rays, or flower classification.

Audio classification with urban sound dataset.

2. Create the GitHub Repository Structure

Follow the structure required:

project_name/
    README.md
    notebook/
        project_name.ipynb
    src/
        preprocessing.py
        model.py
        prediction.py
    data/
        train/
        test/
    models/
        model_name.pkl or model_name.tf


Purpose in the rubric:

Needed for retraining and prediction evaluation.

Required for deployment.

Phase 2: Offline Model Development
1. Data Acquisition

Download dataset.

Store raw data in the /data/train and /data/test folders.

2. Data Processing

Write preprocessing.py with:

Loading images or audio files.

Normalization.

Label encoding.

Train test split functions.

Augmentation if using images.

Document this in the notebook.

3. Model Creation

Create model.py with:

A custom CNN or a pretrained transfer learning model.

Functions for compile, train, save, load.

Notebook must include:

Clear preprocessing.

Regularization.

Optimizer choice.

Early stopping.

Data augmentation if applicable.

Rubric coverage:

Evaluation of Models: model optimization, preprocessing clarity.

4. Model Testing and Evaluation

In the notebook:

Produce at least 4 metrics:

Accuracy

Loss

Precision

Recall

F1 score

Confusion matrix

Save the model to the models/ folder.

Rubric coverage:

Evaluation of Models.

Phase 3: Retraining Capability

Create an automated retraining pipeline.

1. Implement Retraining in model.py

A function that takes new files, runs preprocessing, merges them with training data, and retrains the model.

2. Implement Upload Functionality

Users upload a folder of images or audio files.

Save the files into a database or storage folder (for this assignment, a folder is acceptable).

Trigger a retrain action.

Rubric coverage:

Retraining Process: data upload, preprocessing, retraining with pre-trained model.

Phase 4: API Development

Create a FastAPI or Flask API.

Required endpoints:

Predict one datapoint from an image or audio file.

Upload bulk data for retraining.

Trigger retraining.

Model up-time endpoint (health check).

Endpoint for model metrics in production.

File prediction.py will contain:

Load model.

Process single image or audio.

Return predicted label.

Rubric coverage:

Prediction Process

Retraining Process

Deployment Package

Phase 5: UI Development

Create a simple web interface using Streamlit or React with a Python backend.

Required UI features:

Predict from a single image or audio file.

Upload new training data (bulk).

Button to trigger retraining.

Model up-time display.

Display production metrics and visualizations.

Visualizations of at least three dataset features with interpretation.

Examples of features:

Distribution of classes.

Spectrogram frequencies in audio.

Image brightness or color histograms.

Rubric coverage:

Deployment Package

Visualizations

Prediction Process

Phase 6: Deployment in the Cloud

Deploy using your choice:

AWS EC2

Google Cloud Run

Azure App Service

Render

Railway

Docker container deployment

Deployment requirements:

API running in production.

UI running and accessible.

Model loaded in production.

Rubric coverage:

Deployment Package

Flood request simulation (next phase)

Phase 7: Load Testing with Locust

Tasks:

Write a locustfile.py to simulate multiple prediction requests.

Run tests with different numbers of Docker containers.

Record:

Latency

Response time

Success rate

Add these results to the README and video.

Rubric:

Video Demo must show load testing.

Deployment Package for production evaluation.
